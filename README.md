Description:
During a configuration review of the Windows system, it was identified that standard users can install executable (.exe) files without restriction. When attempting to install an EXE file, the system prompts for elevated privileges. However, a normal user can simply cancel the prompt and proceed to install the EXE or software from the internet, bypassing the elevation process.

Impact:
This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized software installations on the system, potentially allowing malicious software to be installed. Attackers could exploit this by tricking standard users into running malicious executables, compromising the system's integrity and security.

Likelihood:
Medium - While this issue requires user interaction (canceling the prompt), it is still possible for standard users to bypass the prompt, especially if they are not aware of the risks of installing unknown software.

Remediation:

Enforce software restriction policies to prevent the installation of unauthorized executables by standard users.

Implement a more stringent User Account Control (UAC) policy to prevent bypassing of the prompt.

Educate users about the risks of downloading and installing software from untrusted sources.

Restrict the use of external devices that could introduce malicious software, such as USB drives.
