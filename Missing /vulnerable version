Finding: Use of Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries
Severity: High
Category: A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components (OWASP Top 10)

Description
The application was found to be using multiple outdated third-party libraries containing known security vulnerabilities:

DOMPurify 2.5.6 – Vulnerable to Mutation XSS and prototype pollution (CVE-2024-47875), allowing maliciously crafted HTML to bypass sanitization and execute arbitrary JavaScript.

DOMPurify 3.1.6 – Affected by the same mXSS issue (CVE-2024-47875).

Bootstrap 4.6.2 – Vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw in the Carousel component (CVE-2024-6531) due to insufficient sanitization of certain attributes.

jQuery UI 1.12.1 – Contains multiple XSS vulnerabilities, including issues in the Datepicker widget (CVE-2021-41182, CVE-2021-41183, CVE-2021-41184) and checkboxradio component (CVE-2022-31160).

Vue 2.7.16 – Affected by a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in HTML parsing (CVE-2024-9506) and an XSS risk via the vue-template-compiler (CVE-2024-6783).

These vulnerabilities are publicly documented, actively known, and could be exploited if user-controlled input is processed by these libraries in a vulnerable manner.

Impact
Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow:

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in users’ browsers, enabling credential theft, session hijacking, or UI redressing attacks.

Prototype Pollution: Injection of malicious properties into JavaScript object prototypes, potentially altering application behavior and enabling indirect XSS.

Denial of Service: The ReDoS vulnerability in Vue could cause performance degradation or service disruption.

Reconnaissance: Attackers could study library versions to craft targeted exploits against known weaknesses.

Because these components are client-facing, exploitation would occur in the context of the victim’s browser, making it a high-impact vector for session compromise or data theft.

Recommendation
Upgrade vulnerable libraries to the latest patched versions:

DOMPurify → ≥ 3.2.6

Bootstrap → latest stable release addressing CVE-2024-6531

jQuery UI → ≥ 1.13.2

Vue → apply patches for CVE-2024-9506 and CVE-2024-6783, or migrate to Vue 3+

Review dependency management processes to ensure security patches are applied promptly.

Implement SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools in CI/CD pipelines to detect outdated and vulnerable dependencies early.

Validate and sanitize all user-supplied content server-side, in addition to client-side protections, to provide layered defense against XSS and injection attacks.
