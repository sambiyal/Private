Additionally, Cloud Migrator writes sensitive credentials to disk in cleartext within local project files. This includes both the “Default User Password” as well as the actual login credentials entered by operators when authenticating to the Cloud Migrator tool. These are not tokenized or encrypted but stored as raw usernames and passwords. As a result, anyone with access to the file system (e.g., a local attacker, malicious insider, or via backup leakage) can recover valid Cloud Migrator login credentials and reuse them for unauthorized access.
