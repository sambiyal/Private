Finding: Staging Environment Accessible Over the Internet
Severity: Low
Category: Information Disclosure / Attack Surface Expansion

Description
A staging environment for the application was identified as being accessible from the public internet. This environment is protected by authentication and two-factor authentication (2FA), which reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access.

While staging environments are often used for development, testing, and UAT purposes, exposing them externally increases the applicationâ€™s attack surface. Even with authentication controls, staging systems may:

Contain untested or pre-release features with undiscovered vulnerabilities.

Run with relaxed security configurations compared to production.

Use test data that could still contain sensitive information.

Provide attackers with an opportunity to map internal APIs and workflows.

Impact
The presence of an externally accessible staging environment, even with authentication and 2FA, slightly increases the risk that:

Attackers could attempt credential stuffing or brute-force attacks against staging accounts.

Vulnerabilities in staging could be discovered and later targeted in production.

Misconfigurations could leak information that aids an attacker.

Given the layered authentication controls, the likelihood of exploitation is low, but the impact could be moderate if staging security is weaker than production.

Evidence
Staging subdomain accessible via HTTPS over the public internet.

Login page requires username/password and 2FA code.

Verified 2FA prompt and successful redirection to staging application dashboard upon valid authentication.

Recommendation
Restrict network access to staging via VPN or IP allowlisting to reduce exposure.

Ensure staging security controls match production standards.

Use only masked or synthetic data in staging.

Maintain logging and monitoring on staging for suspicious activity.
