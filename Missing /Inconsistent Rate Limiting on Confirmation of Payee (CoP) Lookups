Missing / Inconsistent Rate Limiting on Confirmation of Payee (CoP) Lookups

Description:
During testing of the Confirmation of Payee (CoP) functionality, it was identified that rate limiting controls are inconsistently applied across different lookup methods:

File Upload (Verify)

When performing CoP lookups via the bulk file upload “verify” feature, there is no rate limit in place.

Testing confirmed that the application continued to process requests beyond 1,000+ entries without any throttling or rejection.

Manual Lookup (Form Input)

When performing CoP lookups via the manual input method (entering Account Name, BSB, and Account Number), a rate limit is enforced at approximately 200 requests per session/IP, after which the response indicates the limit has been reached.

The absence of consistent rate limiting allows attackers to perform high-volume CoP lookups via the file upload method without detection or restriction.

Impact:
Enumeration Risk: Attackers can automate CoP lookups using the file upload method to verify large sets of account details.

Data Harvesting: Bulk enumeration could be used to validate account holder names, aiding in social engineering, targeted phishing, or payment fraud.

Compliance Risk: Failure to restrict bulk lookups may violate financial regulatory requirements regarding customer data protection.

Inconsistent Security Posture: The presence of rate limits in one functionality but not in another suggests oversight and may indicate similar gaps in other high-value endpoints.

Likelihood:
High – The attack can be automated and requires no special privileges beyond access to the file upload CoP feature.

Recommendation:
The application should implement consistent and robust rate limiting across all Confirmation of Payee (CoP) lookup methods, including both manual entry and file upload functionality, to prevent abuse and excessive resource consumption. Uniform server-side request throttling should be applied with strict per-user and per-IP thresholds, ensuring these limits are enforced regardless of the request method. In addition, the system should log and monitor all high-volume lookup activity, generate alerts for potential misuse, and introduce safeguards such as CAPTCHAs, multi-factor verification, or manual approval workflows for unusually large requests. Standardizing these measures will help prevent mass account enumeration, protect sensitive customer information, and maintain a consistent security posture across the platform.

Evidence:
Manual Entry CoP Lookup: Rate limit triggered after ~200 requests.

File Upload CoP Lookup: Successfully processed 1,000+ entries without rate limiting or blocking.

Screenshots and request logs retained from both test cases.
