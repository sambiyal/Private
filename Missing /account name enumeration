Description
During the payment process within an authenticated session, the system checks whether the payee name entered by the user matches the name registered to the account identifier (such as a phone number or email address).

Testing showed that if a valid phone number or email is provided, but the name does not match:

The payment is halted (expected), but

The application returns the actual registered name for that identifier.

This effectively turns the payment validation step into an account name lookup tool for any authenticated user.

Steps to Reproduce
Log in to the application with valid credentials.

Initiate a payment to any recipient.

Enter:

Valid phone number or email belonging to a target account.

Incorrect/random name instead of the correct account holder’s name.

Submit the payment request.

Observe:

Payment is not processed.

The system displays the correct registered name associated with the phone number or email.

Repeat with:

Known identifiers.

Randomly generated identifiers to discover active accounts.

Impact
Any authenticated user can:

Confirm whether a phone number or email belongs to a registered account.

Enumerate real account holder names linked to those identifiers.

Perform bulk enumeration via file uploads or automated tools.

Use the collected data for:

Phishing and targeted fraud.

Identity theft.

Reconnaissance for social engineering campaigns.

When combined with automation, this flaw allows large-scale data harvesting with minimal effort.

Evidence
Evidence 1: Payment file uploaded after login containing recipient identifiers and incorrect names.

Evidence 2: Automated replay of the request via Burp Intruder (1000+ times).

Evidence 3 & 4: Intruder responses consistently reveal correct names for valid identifiers.

Evidence 5: Application interface shows processed payment checks with the revealed names.

Recommendation
Only reveal the recipient’s name if both the provided identifier and name exactly match.

For mismatches, display a generic error message (e.g., “Details do not match”) without revealing the correct registered name.

Apply strict rate limiting to payment validation endpoints, even for authenticated users.

Monitor for high-volume lookups and flag unusual patterns.
