Description
The application’s payment process contains a logic flaw that allows authenticated users to discover the real registered name of any account holder linked to a valid phone number or email address.

When initiating a payment, the system is expected to verify that the provided payee name matches the account identifier before proceeding. However, if the user supplies a valid phone number or email but an incorrect or random name, the system:

Halts the payment (intended behavior), but

Displays the correct registered name associated with that identifier (unintended behavior).

This behavior effectively turns the payment validation step into an account name lookup service available to any logged-in user. By repeatedly submitting identifiers, an attacker can enumerate the names of registered account holders at scale.
Steps to Reproduce
Log in to the application with valid credentials.

Initiate a payment to any recipient.

Enter:

Valid phone number or email belonging to a target account.

Incorrect/random name instead of the correct account holder’s name.

Submit the payment request.

Observe:

Payment is not processed.

The system displays the correct registered name associated with the phone number or email.

Repeat with:

Known identifiers.

Randomly generated identifiers to discover active accounts.

Impact
Any authenticated user can:

Confirm whether a phone number or email belongs to a registered account.

Enumerate real account holder names linked to those identifiers.

Perform bulk enumeration via file uploads or automated tools.

Use the collected data for:

Phishing and targeted fraud.

Identity theft.

Reconnaissance for social engineering campaigns.

When combined with automation, this flaw allows large-scale data harvesting with minimal effort.

Evidence
Screenshot 1:
Preparation of a payment file containing payee information, including phone numbers and intentionally incorrect payee names for testing.

Screenshot 2:
Upload of the prepared payment file to the application’s payment processing feature within an authenticated session.

Screenshot 3:
Application response halts the payment due to a name mismatch but reveals the actual registered account holder’s name associated with the provided phone number.

Recommendation
Only reveal the recipient’s name if both the provided identifier and name exactly match.

For mismatches, display a generic error message (e.g., “Details do not match”) without revealing the correct registered name.

Apply strict rate limiting to payment validation endpoints, even for authenticated users.

Monitor for high-volume lookups and flag unusual patterns.
