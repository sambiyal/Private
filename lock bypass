roken Access Control – Client-Side Lock Bypass on Investigation Records

Technical Details

The application implements a locking mechanism to prevent multiple users from simultaneously editing the same Investigation ID. This is intended to ensure data integrity by restricting access to a single user until the record is released.

During testing, it was observed that this lock enforcement is performed only on the client-side. The application UI prevents users from opening or editing an already locked investigation, but this validation can be bypassed by manipulating client-side controls or intercepting/modifying the request in tools such as Burp Suite.

As a result, multiple users can access and make changes to the same investigation simultaneously, despite the UI showing it as locked. This confirms that the server does not properly validate whether a record is locked before processing user requests.

This aligns with OWASP Top 10 2021 – A01: Broken Access Control, specifically the subcategory of Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security.

Impact Details

The lack of proper server-side validation allows any user to bypass the intended record-locking mechanism. This introduces several risks:

Data Integrity Issues: Multiple users editing the same record concurrently can overwrite each other’s changes, leading to loss of critical information.

Inconsistent Business Workflow: The application’s core design to prevent simultaneous edits is undermined, leading to operational disruption.

Audit and Compliance Risks: Logs and audit trails may not accurately reflect who made the latest changes, complicating forensic investigations.

Potential Privilege Escalation: A user who should only be able to “wait” for a lock release can illegitimately perform actions as though the lock was never present.

Overall, this vulnerability reduces confidence in the application’s access control mechanisms and creates opportunities for abuse.

Recommendations

Enforce Lock Validation on the Server

Implement lock verification at the API/backend layer.

Every update or edit request should be validated against the current lock state of the Investigation ID.

Reject Unauthorized Requests

If the investigation is already locked by another user, the server must reject subsequent requests with an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 403 Forbidden).

Do Not Rely on Client-Side Enforcement

Lock status checks must be validated server-side. Client-side logic (UI messages, disabled buttons) should only complement the enforcement, not replace it.

Testing & Monitoring

Add automated tests to simulate multiple concurrent access attempts.

Log all lock bypass attempts for monitoring and incident response.
