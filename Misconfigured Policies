During the wireless security assessment, two major policy violations were identified on SSIDs TGuest and DAPiau, both of which were supposed to be tightly controlled environments:

Case 1: TGuest SSID Allows Access to Corporate Services
The SSID TGuest is intended for isolated guest Wi-Fi access, and corporate policy specifies that devices connected to it (including corporate-issued laptops) should not have any access to the internet or internal resources.

However, during testing:

A corporate laptop connected to the TGuest SSID was able to successfully reach various external portals, including:

https://login.microsoftonline.com

https://onedrive.live.com

https://<company>.sharepoint.com

This implies incomplete egress filtering or an unmonitored allowlist that unintentionally permits corporate SaaS resources.

This could allow data exfiltration from managed devices through guest Wi-Fi, bypassing firewall policies, CASB logging, or DLP controls.

Case 2: TGuest and DAPiau SSIDs Have No Internet Restrictions
It was observed that devices connected to both TGuest and DAPiau SSIDs had full, unrestricted internet access, despite expectations or policies that these networks should:

Restrict access to only approved business services.

Block access to personal or high-risk categories (e.g., social media, gambling, file-sharing).

Testing confirmed that sites like:

https://youtube.com

https://mega.nz

https://stake.com

https://facebook.com
were fully accessible from both SSIDs.

This defeats the purpose of segmentation and opens avenues for:

Non-compliant internet usage

Malware downloads or command & control beaconing

Shadow IT and personal device abuse

ðŸ’£ Impact:
Devices on guest networks may bypass security controls and connect to corporate SaaS environments or conduct unaudited data transfers.

Users can access unfiltered internet, exposing the environment to phishing, malware, or unauthorized resource usage.

Violates least-privilege and network segmentation principles, increasing the attack surface.

May result in compliance failures (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI DSS, NIST, etc.) if policies demand network segregation and content filtering.

ðŸŽ¯ Likelihood:
High

This issue was observed consistently across multiple sessions, with no endpoint or NAC enforcement in place. An attacker or insider with physical presence could exploit this easily using a Wi-Fi-enabled device.

âœ… Recommendation:
Review and enforce network segmentation policies on all guest and restricted SSIDs.

Configure firewall ACLs to block all outbound traffic from TGuest and DAPiau, unless explicitly allowed.

For TGuest, restrict outbound access to DNS/NTP and portal whitelists only (if captive portal is in use).

Implement content filtering (via Zscaler, Umbrella, FortiGuard, etc.) to block high-risk or non-business domains.

Consider integrating Network Access Control (NAC) or 802.1X to dynamically enforce posture-based rules.

Log all outbound access from guest SSIDs for anomaly detection.
