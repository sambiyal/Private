Vulnerability Name:
Lack of Management Frame Protection (PMF) on Wi-Fi Access Point

üìù Description:
The targeted Wi-Fi Access Point (SSID: CorpWiFi, BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55) was found to have Protected Management Frames (PMF) disabled. PMF, defined in IEEE 802.11w, protects critical Wi-Fi management frames (such as deauthentication, disassociation, and action frames) from spoofing and tampering.

Without PMF, attackers within radio range can inject forged management frames to disconnect clients or manipulate wireless behavior, which facilitates Evil Twin, Man-in-the-Middle (MitM), and DoS attacks.

üí£ Impact:
Clients can be forcefully disconnected (DoS) using deauthentication/disassociation attacks.

Enables Evil Twin attacks, where clients connect to rogue APs impersonating the legitimate one.

Can be exploited to bypass network segmentation by luring devices onto attacker-controlled APs.

Undermines the confidentiality and integrity of enterprise Wi-Fi infrastructure.

üéØ Likelihood:
High

The attack is simple to execute using tools like aireplay-ng or mdk4, and does not require credentials or access to the internal network. Most off-the-shelf wireless adapters can perform this attack from public areas near the target environment.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Enable PMF (802.11w) in "Required" mode for all WPA2 and WPA3 SSIDs.

Ensure all client devices support PMF to avoid compatibility issues.

Monitor for management frame injection and unauthorized disassociation activity using Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS).

Regularly update AP firmware to enforce modern security standards.

üì∏ Supporting Evidence (Screenshot Caption):
Screenshot: Wi-Fi beacon frame captured with Wireshark, showing 802.11w PMF field set to 0 (disabled) for SSID CorpWiFi, BSSID 00:11:22:33:44:55.
