Account Number Enumeration

Technical Details:
The Confirmation of Payee (CoP) functionality reveals distinct system responses depending on whether the entered account number exists in the system.

When a valid account number & BSB is provided with a wrong name, the system returns:
"Account name not matched to the account"

When a valid account number, BSB, and correct account name is provided, the system returns:
"Account name matched"

When an invalid account name, valid BSB, and incrementally guessed account number is entered:

If the account exists → "Account name not found"

If the account does not exist → "Account does not exist"

This behavior enables an attacker to enumerate valid account numbers by observing differences in the application’s responses.

The root cause is the absence of generic error messaging and uniform response handling for all account validation failures.

Impact:

Enables attackers to perform brute-force enumeration of account numbers for a given BSB.

Could be used to harvest valid bank account details for fraudulent transactions, social engineering, or further targeted attacks.

May lead to privacy violations and compliance breaches under financial regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, or equivalent).

Recommendation:

Implement Generic Error Messages

Return a single, generic response for all failed validations, such as:
"The account details provided could not be verified"

Rate Limiting & Monitoring

Implement per-IP and per-account rate limits for CoP lookups.

Monitor for unusual lookup patterns and alert security teams.

Input Validation & Throttling

Use CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts.

Audit Logs

Ensure detailed logs of all lookup attempts for incident response.

Evidence:

Screenshots showing the different responses:

Wrong name + valid BSB & account → “Account name not matched”

Correct details → “Account name matched”

Invalid name + valid BSB & guessed account → “Account name not found”

Invalid name + valid BSB & non-existent account → “Account does not exist”
