ulnerability: Input/Output Validation
📄 Summary
The application fails to properly sanitize user input before storing it in the backend database. While the frontend performs HTML output encoding—preventing immediate execution of malicious content—the raw, unsanitized data remains stored. This introduces a latent stored XSS risk, especially if the same data is consumed by other applications or internal tools that do not implement proper output encoding. Although there’s no direct impact in the current application interface, this creates a cross-application security risk.

⚙️ Technical Details
User input containing HTML or JavaScript (e.g., <script>alert(1)</script>) is accepted and stored without server-side sanitization. The frontend safely encodes it (e.g., &lt;script&gt;) during rendering, preventing execution. However, raw payloads remain in the backend, retrievable via APIs or internal services. If another system consumes and displays this data without proper output encoding, stored malicious code can execute—leading to a delayed or indirect stored XSS attack.

🎯 Impact
Although the application’s frontend prevents immediate execution of HTML/JavaScript payloads through output encoding, the lack of server-side sanitization introduces a high-risk stored XSS condition across trust boundaries. If any other internal or third-party application, report generator, email engine, or admin interface consumes this raw data without proper encoding, malicious scripts can execute in those contexts.

🧪 Steps to Reproduce
Submit input such as <script>alert(1)</script> via any form or user field.

Confirm it's stored by viewing the API response or raw database content.

Observe it’s not executed on the frontend due to output encoding.

Inject the same payload into a system that does not encode on output.

Payload executes, confirming a stored XSS scenario.

✅ Recommendation
Implement server-side input sanitization before saving user content.

Ensure output encoding is enforced across all consuming systems.

Apply contextual encoding based on rendering context (HTML, attributes, JavaScript).

Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS impact.

Monitor logs for suspicious patterns in stored input.

🆔 CWE Reference
CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting)
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html

Screenshot 1 – User Input (Injection Point):
Shows that the application accepts raw JavaScript input (<script>alert(1)</script>) without any validation or sanitization at the time of submission.

Screenshot 2 – BurpSuite Request/Response:
Confirms that the malicious payload is stored and returned verbatim in the API response. This proves the backend is not applying any sanitization or encoding before storing or returning the data.

Screenshot 3 – Application Page Rendering:
Displays the JavaScript code visibly in the frontend (e.g., &lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;), confirming that output encoding on the client side is preventing immediate execution — but also indicating that the payload is stored in raw form and only encoded at display time.
