Vulnerability Name:
WPA2-PSK Network Susceptible to Credential Extraction and Offline Cracking via Captured 4-Way Handshake

üìù Description:
The Wi-Fi SSID CorpWiFi is configured using WPA2-PSK (Pre-Shared Key) authentication. During testing, the penetration tester was able to:

Capture a valid 4-way handshake between a legitimate client and the access point (BSSID: 00:11:22:33:44:55) using passive sniffing.

Extract the actual PSK from a corporate-managed Windows machine where the password had been saved in plaintext or retrievable format.

Validate the correctness of the captured handshake by successfully cracking it offline using a custom wordlist containing the extracted password.

While the original password set by the network team was relatively complex, the attack demonstrates that WPA2-PSK remains fundamentally vulnerable to credential disclosure and offline brute-force attacks ‚Äî especially when the same key is reused across devices and users.

This is not just a dictionary-based guessing issue, but a demonstration of how any exposed PSK can be used to crack future handshakes, and gain access to the network without detection or logs.

üí£ Impact:
Compromise of Wi-Fi network access without detection.

Attackers can replay and crack handshakes offline using any leaked or known password.

No individual accountability or revocation once the PSK is known.

Potential for lateral movement, ARP spoofing, or sensitive data exfiltration over the compromised SSID.

Shows that even "complex" passwords are not secure under WPA2-PSK if reused or extractable.

üéØ Likelihood:
High

This finding was proven with a live working exploit path, not theoretical. Once the handshake was captured, the PSK was cracked offline using a targeted dictionary ‚Äî showcasing the real-world exploitability of WPA2-PSK-based networks.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Migrate to WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise (802.1X) for per-user credentials and centralized authentication/auditability.

Avoid storing Wi-Fi passwords on managed devices without encryption or credential protection.

Disable "connect automatically" features for corporate SSIDs to minimize passive handshake capture.

Enable Management Frame Protection (PMF) to reduce deauth-based handshake harvesting attacks.

Regularly rotate WPA2-PSKs and monitor for anomalous MAC/device connections.
